Description
---

The _haskell-rl_ project is a repository on the [Target Git Enterprise server](https://git.target.com) within the [RedOptHaskell organization](https://git.target.com/RedOptHaskell).
It was first created as a central storage point for the code created as a group of us did various exercises from the book: [Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2018mar16.pdf), by Sutton & Barto, as part of a reading group led by [Ramki](mailto:Ramakrishna.Gummadi@target.com), which currently meets every Thursday from 4-5pm in room #201 at the Target Sunnyvale location at 100 Mathilda Place, Sunnyvale, CA, USA.

Examples
---

The following examples are available:

- [tictactoe](https://pages.git.target.com/RedOptHaskell/haskell-rl/tictactoe.html)
- [rentalcars](https://pages.git.target.com/RedOptHaskell/haskell-rl/rentalcars.html)
- [gambler](https://pages.git.target.com/RedOptHaskell/haskell-rl/gambler.html)
- [blackjack](https://pages.git.target.com/RedOptHaskell/haskell-rl/blackjack.html)

Each example above was created from a [literate Haskell](https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming) source file, which you can find in the [_app_ directory of this repository](https://git.target.com/RedOptHaskell/haskell-rl/tree/master/app), and contains:

- Haskell source code,
- links to relevant external resources, and
- example output

for a particular problem.
